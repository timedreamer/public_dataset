This is my dataset repository that are publicly available. Most of these are tables that I constantly refer to. If interested, you can used `[readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html)` package to retrieve it from Github.

1. RAPDB_MSU_ID_conversion_20190403.txt.gz. Refer to [my post](https://jhuang.netlify.com/post/rice-rapdb-to-msu7-id-conversion/) on how I got this table.
